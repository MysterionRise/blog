### Creating New Posts

To create a new blog post, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the appropriate language folder:
   - For English posts: `content/en/posts/`
   - For Russian posts: `content/ru/posts/`

2. Create a new markdown file using the template:
   - Copy the template from `content/templates/post.md`
   - Name your file with a descriptive URL-friendly name (e.g., `my-new-post.md`)

3. Fill in the front matter and content:
   - Update the title, date, tags, and other metadata
   - Write your post content in markdown format
   - For multilingual posts, create versions in both language folders
